=Quickstart Guide for XUP V2P FPGA Board=

==Requirements==
  * a Xilinx University Program Virtex-II Pro board [1] 
  * PC running Linux or Windows^1^
  * Xilinx ISE Suite (tested with 8.103i, should work with later versions too)

^1^ When you want to make use of the Makefile method described below on a Windows machine, a cygwin installation should be present with GNU Make.

==Quickstart==
  # Acquire the latest snapshot from the Downloads section at the r-VEX website, or checkout the latest code from the Subversion repository.
  # Inside the r-VEX/src/ directory, synthesize r-VEX by entering the following command: `make v2p`
  # After the synthesis process has completed, the generated bit-file can be uploaded to the FPGA board by entering: `make fpga`
  # Connect a serial cable to the RS-232 interface on the XUP V2P board. Connect the other side of the cable to a PC, and start a terminal application, like Minicom (Unices), Putty or Hyperterminal (Windows). Connect using the following settings: _115200 bps transfer rate, 8 data bits, no parity_
  # Press button SW2 on the XUP V2P board, which acts as the reset button. In the terminal application, you will see the contents of the first 16 data memory addresses, as well as a cycle counter.

By default, an application is loaded and pre-synthesized to calculate the 45th Fibonacci number, so memory address `0x00` will contain the value `0x43A53F82`.
